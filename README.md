# uta_embedded_systems
A repo to hold code, notes, and everything as I work through the Embedded Systems course by the University of Texas - Austin on edx.

As I've grown more interested in embedded systems, this two-part course will serve as a nice introduction and by keeping everything here
I (and you!) can monitor progress.
